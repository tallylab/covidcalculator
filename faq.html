			<h2 class="mt-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

			<hr>

			<h4>Why isn't there a risk assessment tool for areas outside of the US?</h4>

			<p>We wish there was! A key component of the calculator is the risk assessment tool provided by <a href="https://covidactnow.org" target="_blank">CovidActNow.org</a>, which currently only covers the United States. We're actively trying to find similar tools for regions outside of the US, so please <a href="mailto:info@tallylab.com">contact us</a> if you know of one.</p>
			<p>Bonus points if they have an API; it's very frustrating to immediately send users away to a different website for this information.</p></p>

			<hr>

			<h4>Why did you include alcohol as a variable?</h4>

			<p>For a couple of reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Alcohol <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=effect+of+alcohol+on+perception+of+risk&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart" target="_blank">lowers perception of risk</a>, which may decrease distancing and mask-wearing</li>
				<li>Alcohol <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2031886/" target="_blank">harms hearing</a>, which increases speech volume, which <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2009324" target="_blank">increases the emission of droplets</a></li>
			</ol>

			<hr>

			<h4>Why did you not include eating food as a variable?</h4>

			<p>Eating food, in and of itself, does not appear to be a problem; removing one's mask is the problem, which has to be done in order to eat. If people are going to be eating at the event, the answer to the question about mask-wearing should be "none" or "some", which will raise the event's overall score.</p>

			<hr>

			<h4>Why did you not ask about social distancing?</h4>

			<p>We instead ask about the size of the space and the number of attendees in order to more objectively assess whether at least six feet of distance between attendees is possible. We have plans to make this more precise by enabling entry of a specific number of square feet for the space and a specific number of attendees.</p>

			<p>Further, <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-6-feet-social-distancing-not-always-enough" target="_blank">the recommended six feet of social distancing is a bare minimum</a>. Spacing between attendees who are indoors, or who are not wearing a mask, should ideally be greater than six feet.</p>

			<hr>

			<h4>Why did you not include personal risk factors like age or a pre-existing condition? </h4>

			<p>Two reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First and foremost, the inclusion of personal health factors may create the impression that the tool is dispensing medical advice, which it is not!</li>
				<li>We want to keep the tool as quick and easy to use as possible, while also keeping it as broadly applicable as possible. Our experiments with more variables did not seem to significantly increase accuracy, so we left them out for now.</li>
			</ol>

			<hr>

			<p>If you have questions about the tool, or problems with any of the thinking behind it, feel free to <a href="mailto:info@tallylab.com">email us</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/tallylabapp">tweet at us</a>!</p>

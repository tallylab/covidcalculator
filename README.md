# COVID-19 Situational Risk Calculator
> A tool to help everybody think more clearly about whether or not to attend an in-person event.

## Background

In the context of an on-going global pandemic, people are unsure about whether and when to participate in events outside of the home.

The variables at play are just too numerous and varied for a human brain to be able to deal with comfortably. Also, our understanding of COVID-19 is continuing to evolve, just as the virus itself is.

All of that said, informed decision-making is possible! We just need to be able to weigh the factors effectively. This calculator aims to help with that.

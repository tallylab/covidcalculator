# Contributing to COVID-19 Situational Risk Calculator

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing! Issues and pull requests are encouraged. We are looking for help in the following:

* Finding regional risk level asessment APIs out side of the US
* A function that generates every possible combination of metrics, their resulting score, and shows where they fall in relation to the current score cutoff
* Tests for existing functionality

## First Principles

1. Always have the end-user in mind
2. Aim for high (but not absolute) persona coverage in design
3. Aim for high (but not absolute) code coverage in testing

## Contributing

We welcome all forms of contribution. Please open issues and PRs for:

- Reporting Bugs
- Suggesting Enhancements
- Adding new tests
- Adding new functionality
- Documentation-only updates

## Style

- Git Commit Messages should lean towards [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) but will not be enforced

## Security

If you have discovered a security vulnerability, please open an issue. We'd like to handle things as transparently as possible. If you don't feel like this is prudent, please visit us on one of the chat channels via the badges in the README. One of the core contributors will be able to talk to you about the disclosure.
